# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis
## Objective
I am acting as an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. 
Instacart already has very good sales, but they 
want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. I performed
an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order
to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on
the provided criteria. 

## Data
I was provided with datasets that contained all the customer information:

- Orders
- Orders_Products_Prior
- Products
- Customers
- Departments

## Folders
The project analysis is separated into the following folders:

Project Management: Contains the Project Brief
Data: Separated into Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original data frames and the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. NOTE: This folder has not been included
Scripts: Contains all the Python coding involved for the entire analysis process
Analysis: Contains the Visualizations used for developing insights and presenting on the final report
Sent to client: Contains the Final Report in Excel
